00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,779
<font color="#ffff00">Good man. You have your cardiologist
on speed dial, right?</font>

134
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,517
<font color="#ffff00">Right? You do, right? Hey, girls.</font>

135
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,395
<font color="#ffff00">How are you?
Best meal on wheels right here.</font>

136
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,897
<font color="#ffff00">Tell that to my cheese and bacon panini.
Total foodgasm.</font>

137
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,700
<font color="#ffff00">Bacon?</font>

138
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,500
<font color="#ffff00">Have a good night.</font>

139
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,029
<font color="#ffff00">Bacon.</font>

140
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:26,369
<font color="#ffff00">You know what? I'm also gonna get
the Georgia Dog Special.</font>

141
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,545
<font color="#ffff00">- Yo, chef. Where're you going?
- Two seconds.</font>

142
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,410
<font color="#ffff00">I added to my order.
Do you think he heard it?</font>

143
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,676
<font color="#ffff00">I can't do anything with gloves on.</font>

144
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,440
<font color="#ffff00">What can I get you gulls?</font>

145
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,012
<font color="#ffff00">All right, excellent choice.</font>

146
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,146
<font color="#ffff00">Hey! What do you think you're doing?</font>

147
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,155
<font color="#ffff00">There's a line if you want to order.</font>

148
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:45,059
<font color="#ffff00">The only thing I'm ordering is for you
to stop serving bacon, okay? Pig's our turf.</font>

149
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,996
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, my God! Your turf?</font>

150
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,662
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah.
- Is this West Side Story?</font>

151
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:51,724
<font color="#ffff00">Are we gonna rumble at midnight?</font>

152
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,362
<font color="#ffff00">You know what, maybe I got
a whole gang of back-up dancers</font>

153
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,031
<font color="#ffff00">.just ready to go ck 7. a
- Wow! y'</font>

154
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,130
<font color="#ffff00">You're the cheese truck, so stick to cheese.</font>

155
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,268
<font color="#ffff00">- Can I order now?
- No! Just give me one second, please.</font>

156
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,709
<font color="#ffff00">That's funny, 'cause I noticed that those
jalapeno fritters you guys are serving...</font>

157
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,875
<font color="#ffff00">Are awesome, right? They're my invention.
I made them.</font>

158
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,509
<font color="#ffff00">They have ricotta cheese in them.</font>

159
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,451
<font color="#ffff00">Come on! That's like a little bit of cheese.</font>

160
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,182
<font color="#ffff00">That's nothing compared
to the bacon crutch</font>

161
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,780
<font color="#ffff00">you're propping these sandwiches up on.</font>

162
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,417
<font color="#ffff00">They're paninis, they're grilled peach
and blue cheese paninis,</font>

163
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,961
<font color="#ffff00">with a dash of bacon.</font>

164
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,758
<font color="#ffff00">Also awesome. Also my invention.</font>

165
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,898
<font color="#ffff00">All right, you wanna go? Let's go.
Your special against my special.</font>

166
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,561
<font color="#ffff00">Whoever sells the most tonight, wins.</font>

167
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,237
<font color="#ffff00">- Fine.
- Fine.</font>

168
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,331
<font color="#ffff00">All right, if I win,
you have to have a drink with me.</font>

169
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,332
<font color="#ffff00">And if you win, you may have</font>

170
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,638
<font color="#ffff00">- three drinks with me.
- That's cute.</font>

171
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,203
<font color="#ffff00">So you can stand me up again?
No thank you.</font>

172
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,478
<font color="#ffff00">That was five years ago.
But that's sweet you still remember that.</font>

173
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,917
<font color="#ffff00">I'm impressed, Rosie.</font>

174
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,079
<font color="#ffff00">I'll see you in the field, all right?</font>

175
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,054
<font color="#ffff00">- It doesn't keep me up nights.
- Sure.</font>

176
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,489
<font color="#ffff00">Who's that?</font>

177
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,492
<font color="#ffff00">This guy from high school. Total player.</font>

178
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,054
<font color="#ffff00">I'd play with that.</font>

179
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,996
<font color="#ffff00">Don't be gross. Don't be that girl.</font>

180
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,801
<font color="#ffff00">You're not still hungry, are you?</font>

181
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,932
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know. It depends on what you got left
in your picnic basket.</font>

182
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,205
<font color="#ffff00">Dr. Cooper. We're in a public place.</font>

183
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,974
<font color="#ffff00">I know. It's all so unscheduled.</font>

184
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,105
<font color="#ffff00">I win.</font>

185
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,210
<font color="#ffff00">What did you think was gonna happen?</font>

186
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,412
<font color="#ffff00">Well, I asked you to prom first, all right.
And then you said, "Maybe"</font>

187
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,885
<font color="#ffff00">- so I decided to ask someone else.
- No, I didn't...</font>

188
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,718
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, you did. So I asked someone else.
Then you said, "Yes."</font>

189
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,886
<font color="#ffff00">So I tried to take you both.
What's so wrong with that?</font>

190
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,521
<font color="#ffff00">- I'm not saying it worked.
- Fine.</font>

191
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,856
<font color="#ffff00">I blocked out most of high school anyway.</font>

192
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,798
<font color="#ffff00">Hey. Where'd you get this guy?</font>

193
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,459
<font color="#ffff00">I fought a grill and the grill won.</font>

194
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,004
<font color="#ffff00">Why'd you fight the grill?
It always wins.</font>

195
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,336
<font color="#ffff00">- "Chef hands." Occupational hazard.
- Yeah, guys love it, though.</font>

196
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,305
<font color="#ffff00">- Do they?
- Guys love burned hands.</font>

197
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:13,672
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah? Check this out. Okay.</font>

198
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,145
<font color="#ffff00">First time breaking down a pig
when I was 16.</font>

199
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,181
<font color="#ffff00">- Five stitches. Five. Yeah.
- Five?</font>

200
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,217
<font color="#ffff00">- That is adorable!
- I wasn't asking your opinion, that's okay.</font>

201
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,047
<font color="#ffff00">- That is adorable!
- All right, I wasn't asking your opinion.</font>

202
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,816
<font color="#ffff00">Look. A deli slicer
nearly took my whole thumb off.</font>

203
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,585
<font color="#ffff00">All right. Second-degree burn.
Making caramels.</font>

204
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,225
<font color="#ffff00">- Your own fault.
- Yeah, I know.</font>

205
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,886
<font color="#ffff00">Home-made is the best, though.</font>

206
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,295
<font color="#ffff00">- So good for you for trying.
- Never again. Never again.</font>

207
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,026
<font color="#ffff00">- Julienning shallots.
- Julienning shallots?</font>

208
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,592
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause Julianne, ex-girlfriend, right there,
she got me.</font>

209
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,865
<font color="#ffff00">- Julianne. I see what you did there.
- I know.</font>

210
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,032
<font color="#ffff00">- That's good.
- Yeah? It was good, right? I saved it for you.</font>

211
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,042
<font color="#ffff00">Whoever she was, you probably deserved it.</font>

212
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,812
<font color="#ffff00">What? You are so mean.
Are you always this mean?</font>

213
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,313
<font color="#ffff00">- Always.
- Is that your gift?</font>

214
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,044
<font color="#ffff00">Always?</font>

215
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,947
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

216
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,015
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, Trouble. I'm gonna go.</font>

217
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,123
<font color="#ffff00">- You're gonna go?
- I'm gonna go.</font>

218
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,263
<font color="#ffff00">- It's been super real.
- Where do you think you're going?</font>

219
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:11,165
<font color="#ffff00">- It's been great catching up with you...
- Yes!</font>

220
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,936
<font color="#ffff00">Formal handshake. Good to see you.</font>

221
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,665
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe I'll see you on the truck line</font>

222
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:15,797
<font color="#ffff00">- again sometime, right?
- Yeah.</font>

223
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,268
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, Rosie Brennan.</font>

224
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,468
<font color="#ffff00">- Your hands are on my waist.
- They are on your waist, aren't they?</font>

225
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,773
<font color="#ffff00">How did they find themselves there?
I don't know.</font>

226
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,247
<font color="#ffff00">This is really awkward, isn't it?</font>

227
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,283
<font color="#ffff00">Well, if you don't stop me,
I'm just gonna kiss you.</font>

228
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,284
<font color="#ffff00">Is that gonna be okay?</font>

229
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,601
<font color="#ffff00">This is me getting in my car.</font>

230
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,070
<font color="#ffff00">This is you waving goodbye.</font>

231
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,542
<font color="#ffff00">My zipper's stuck.</font>

232
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,048
<font color="#ffff00">Is that our alarm?</font>

233
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,175
<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

234
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,846
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah. Definitely.
- No, I think our car's that way.</font>

235
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,320
<font color="#ffff00"><i>No, it's this way.</i></font>

236
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,771
<font color="#ffff00">Water feels so good.</font>

237
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,172
<font color="#ffff00">Good, baby.</font>

238
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,402
<font color="#ffff00">Do you want some tea?</font>

239
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,873
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

240
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,040
<font color="#ffff00">Are you sure you're not freaking out?</font>

241
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,948
<font color="#ffff00">Seriously, I mean, just say so.
I can handle it.</font>

242
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,550
<font color="#ffff00">Freak out's a little strong.</font>

243
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,885
<font color="#ffff00">I really thought I had a bum fallopian tube.</font>

244
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,055
<font color="#ffff00">- I just don't wanna force it.
- Hey, Crazy.</font>

245
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,692
<font color="#ffff00">I wanted to be with you
before you were pregnant.</font>

246
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,026
<font color="#ffff00">This just speeds things up a little.</font>

247
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,323
<font color="#ffff00">- A lot.
- So?</font>

248
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,192
<font color="#ffff00">We're old enough. We love each other.</font>

249
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,268
<font color="#ffff00">What's to figure out?</font>

250
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,035
<font color="#ffff00">Apart from what are you gonna do
about your show?</font>

251
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,441
<font color="#ffff00">Well, we start filming in three weeks</font>

252
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,070
<font color="#ffff00">and I'll be finished before I have to deliver.</font>

253
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:08,543
<font color="#ffff00">So, basically, I am going to be
helping people get thin while I get fat.</font>

254
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,349
<font color="#ffff00">What are you doing?</font>

255
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,012
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah!</font>

256
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,688
<font color="#ffff00">- Shit! My tattoo!
- So what?</font>

257
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:22,565
<font color="#ffff00">You're not gonna be the only mom out there
with that Spring Break dolphin. Trust me.</font>

258
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,192
<font color="#ffff00">But those other moms
aren't getting judged like me.</font>

259
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:28,131
<font color="#ffff00">Good call, Holly.
<i>"I'll never get tired of a dolphin."</i></font>

260
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,699
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not tired of it. I smile every time I see it.</font>

261
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,710
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, God! Stop!</font>

262
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,474
<font color="#ffff00">Let's do it.</font>

263
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,915
<font color="#ffff00">- Let's see.
- Okay.</font>

264
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,787
<font color="#ffff00">No, no, no!</font>

265
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:44,877
<font color="#ffff00">What? No!</font>

266
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,622
<font color="#ffff00">- Even our wedding photo?
- I'm not taking any chances.</font>

267
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,915
<font color="#ffff00">Okay?</font>

268
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,553
<font color="#ffff00">Be normal.</font>

269
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,901
<font color="#ffff00">And you're planning on
bringing the baby home here?</font>

270
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,128
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah, we're...
- No.</font>

271
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,762
<font color="#ffff00">No, this is just a rental.</font>

272
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,103
<font color="#ffff00">We're buying a house, a really nice house.</font>

273
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:08,441
<font color="#ffff00">A big yard, one story,
no pool or sharp edges of any kind.</font>

274
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,276
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, we're moving into a padded cell.</font>

275
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,908
<font color="#ffff00">And why did you choose Ethiopia?</font>

276
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:18,150
<font color="#ffff00">Honestly, we would have been happy
adopting from anywhere.</font>

277
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,783
<font color="#ffff00">We were on a waiting list for Guatemala,
but then they closed their adoptions.</font>

278
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:25,124
<font color="#ffff00">So we started researching Ethiopia
and we just...</font>

279
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,954
<font color="#ffff00">We just really fell in love with the culture.</font>

280
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,630
<font color="#ffff00">Plus, all the white babies were taken.</font>

281
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,702
<font color="#ffff00">You're a comedian?</font>

282
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,195
<font color="#ffff00">- No. He's not.
- No.</font>

283
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,101
<font color="#ffff00">- He's not even funny. At all.
- Yeah.</font>

284
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:43,771
<font color="#ffff00">What he does is, he actually picks songs
for commercials for an ad agency.</font>

285
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,074
<font color="#ffff00">- Great health insurance.
- Yeah.</font>

286
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:49,551
<font color="#ffff00">They're working on a big ad
for Delta Air Lines...</font>

287
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,111
<font color="#ffff00">Well, we're bidding on it.
It's not a done deal yet.</font>

288
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,582
<font color="#ffff00">And how's the photography business?</font>

289
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,217
<font color="#ffff00">Well, I'm still waiting for the Guggenheim
to start collecting my work.</font>

290
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:00,024
<font color="#ffff00">But until then, I'm shooting at
the Aquarium.</font>

291
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,156
<font color="#ffff00">And, you know, it pays the bills.</font>

292
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,136
<font color="#ffff00">"All the white babies were taken"?</font>

293
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,670
<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

294
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:09,897
<font color="#ffff00">Cookie?</font>

295
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:10,997
<font color="#ffff00">No, thank you.</font>

296
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,235
<font color="#ffff00">So you think we're looking at a year?</font>

297
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,769
<font color="#ffff00">Well, every case has its own time line.
You just have to be patient.</font>

298
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,309
<font color="#ffff00">But on average, yes, a year. Maybe more.</font>

299
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,948
<font color="#ffff00">More?</font>

300
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,583
<font color="#ffff00">I could work with that, right?
Yeah, that sounds good.</font>

301
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,187
<font color="#ffff00">So does that mean you like us?</font>

302
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,986
<font color="#ffff00">I don't see any red flags.</font>

303
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:36,361
<font color="#ffff00">But you need to baby-proof
if you're going to stay here.</font>

304
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,999
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. Of course.</font>

305
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,528
<font color="#ffff00">Do you have a wedding photo?</font>

306
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,901
<font color="#ffff00">The Ethiopian authorities really like to
see that in the packet.</font>

307
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,837
<font color="#ffff00">- No.
- Yeah, we do.</font>

308
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,103
<font color="#ffff00">- Of course we do. Yeah, we do.
- No, we don't. We lost it.</font>

309
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,305
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah. We do. Where is it?
- No! No! No!</font>

310
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,449
<font color="#ffff00">I think it's right here.</font>

311
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,748
<font color="#ffff00">Vegas. It was a costume wedding.</font>

312
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,212
<font color="#ffff00">I was Prince, Holly was a showgirl.</font>

313
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,249
<font color="#ffff00"><i>He loves Purple Rain.</i></font>

314
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,693
<font color="#ffff00">You know what, why don't we just say
it got burned in a fire?</font>

315
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,260
<font color="#ffff00">Good one.</font>

316
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,822
<font color="#ffff00">- Here.
- Thank you.</font>

317
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:14,133
<font color="#ffff00">Wendy, can I go
on my 15-minute Facebook break?</font>

318
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,531
<font color="#ffff00">Wendy?</font>

319
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,537
<font color="#ffff00">Wendy?</font>

320
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,634
<font color="#ffff00">Are you dead?</font>

321
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,507
<font color="#ffff00">Hey.</font>

322
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:27,073
<font color="#ffff00">Man, I was dreaming
that I had a kangaroo pouch.</font>

323
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,950
<font color="#ffff00">That sounds awesome.</font>

324
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:32,446
<font color="#ffff00">It was like a purse.
I could hide my snacks in it.</font>

325
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,922
<font color="#ffff00">You're like a human-kanga hybrid.</font>

326
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,453
<font color="#ffff00">I like to rub my breasts, too.</font>

327
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,398
<font color="#ffff00">Gary! Gar Bear!</font>

328
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:53,135
<font color="#ffff00">Gar! Gary! Gar Bear! Gar!</font>

329
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,470
<font color="#ffff00">- Wendy!
- We're pregnant!</font>

330
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,682
<font color="#ffff00">I'm with child! We're pregnant!</font>

331
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,445
<font color="#ffff00">- Oh, my God!
- We did it!</font>

332
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:07,046
<font color="#ffff00">My balls work! My balls work! Oh, my God!</font>

333
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,325
<font color="#ffff00">Keep it in your lane, people.</font>

334
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,190
<font color="#ffff00">I did it! I did it!</font>

335
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:14,163
<font color="#ffff00">- We did it! We're gonna have a baby!
- We made a baby!</font>

336
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,637
<font color="#ffff00">Shit!</font>

337
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,468
<font color="#ffff00">Rosie, hurry up!
I need my lucky bra for my interview.</font>

338
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,137
<font color="#ffff00">Ro!</font>

339
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,842
<font color="#ffff00">Two seconds, that's all I wanted.</font>

340
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:32,040
<font color="#ffff00">What's her deal?
I thought she finally got laid.</font>

341
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,139
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know.</font>

342
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,543
<font color="#ffff00">I love these hardwood floors!</font>

343
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,652
<font color="#ffff00">This is it, baby. It's so perfect.
This is the one.</font>

344
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,221
<font color="#ffff00">Are you insane?
We're not buying, we're just looking.</font>

345
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,855
<font color="#ffff00">You want the house or the baby?</font>

346
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,329
<font color="#ffff00">I want the house for the baby.</font>

347
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,627
<font color="#ffff00">We can't afford it.</font>

348
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,826
<font color="#ffff00">- Hi.
- Hi.</font>

349
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,500
<font color="#ffff00">Hi.</font>

350
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,299
<font color="#ffff00">Look, this is it.
This is the one we have to get.</font>

351
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,535
<font color="#ffff00">We're just looking.</font>

352
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,313
<font color="#ffff00">- Stop worrying.
- Okay, okay.</font>

353
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,577
<font color="#ffff00">It's just, he gives me a hard time
when I'm late, you know.</font>

354
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,644
<font color="#ffff00">Don't let him get into your head.</font>

355
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:13,053
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. Okay. You're right.
He can't ruin this. Not today.</font>

356
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,522
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

357
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,252
<font color="#ffff00">So, Dad.</font>

358
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:22,158
<font color="#ffff00">Wendy and I have
a little announcement to make.</font>

359
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,457
<font color="#ffff00">- We're pregnant!
- We're pregnant!</font>

360
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,330
<font color="#ffff00">Oh. my God!</font>

361
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:29,897
<font color="#ffff00">Isn't that great?</font>

362
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:33,738
<font color="#ffff00">- So are we!
- What?</font>

363
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,278
<font color="#ffff00">You're... What, are you... Are you kidding?</font>

364
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:39,007
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, hell's bells.
I guess it's congratulations to all of us.</font>

365
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:43,084
<font color="#ffff00">Holy... I had no idea
that you guys were even trying.</font>

366
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,683
<font color="#ffff00">- We weren't!
- No.</font>

367
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,883
<font color="#ffff00">Now, look, son,
there's no blanks in this pistol.</font>

368
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,357
<font color="#ffff00">Boom!</font>

369
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,254
<font color="#ffff00">You guys, you've been trying
for quite a while.</font>

370
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,161
<font color="#ffff00">What two, three months?
Something like that?</font>

371
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,990
<font color="#ffff00">Two years.</font>

372
00:20:58,457 --> 00:20:59,868
<font color="#ffff00">Not everything's a race, Dad.</font>

373
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,127
<font color="#ffff00">- Gar.
- No.</font>

374
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,695
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah. Right?
- No. Not everything.</font>

375
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,099
<font color="#ffff00">Only things where you can come in first.</font>

376
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,273
<font color="#ffff00">- Okay.
- Come on.</font>

377
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:10,211
<font color="#ffff00">Gary, let's celebrate.
Let's go to Margaritaville.</font>

378
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,215
<font color="#ffff00">- I don't wanna go to Margarita ville.
- Come on.</font>

379
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,716
<font color="#ffff00">I don't wanna go to Margarita ville.</font>

380
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,417
<font color="#ffff00">Everybody wants to go to Margarita ville.</font>

381
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,147
<font color="#ffff00">- I don't wanna go.
- Come on!</font>

382
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,852
<font color="#ffff00">I'm gonna break out
the Don Julio "Blank-o."</font>

383
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:26,518
<font color="#ffff00">"Blanco," Dad. "Blanco."
That's how you pronounce it.</font>

384
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,121
<font color="#ffff00">And it's 11:00 a.m., kind of early for shots.</font>

385
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,025
<font color="#ffff00">- It's 5:00 somewhere.
- True.</font>

386
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,396
<font color="#ffff00">- Don't be a pussy.
- You know what?</font>

387
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,869
<font color="#ffff00">Margarita ville is abierto for business.</font>

388
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:40,535
<font color="#ffff00">Wendy, I just have to say, I am just
so happy to have a baby expert in the family.</font>

389
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,874
<font color="#ffff00">Are you feeling anything yet?</font>

390
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:43,969
<font color="#ffff00"><i>JOY-</i></font>

391
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,709
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah.
- Some exhaustion.</font>

392
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:49,214
<font color="#ffff00">A little nausea. Some heartburn.
And my boobs are killing me.</font>

393
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,585
<font color="#ffff00">Plus, I have to pee every five minutes.</font>

394
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:56,319
<font color="#ffff00">But it's just proof
that a miracle is happening inside of me.</font>

395
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,985
<font color="#ffff00">So I'm so happy-</font>

396
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,561
<font color="#ffff00">It is a miracle, isn't it?</font>

397
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:03,361
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, I thought I'd have to
give up my Pilates, and my running</font>

398
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:07,964
<font color="#ffff00">- and tennis and my strip-aerobics.
- Sure.</font>

399
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:10,597
<font color="#ffff00">And kickboxing, just all my activities.</font>

400
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,938
<font color="#ffff00">But it just turns out
I have all this extra energy.</font>

401
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,211
<font color="#ffff00">- You know? You know?
- Oh, yeah.</font>

402
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,746
<font color="#ffff00">Plus,</font>

403
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:19,646
<font color="#ffff00">I'm like crazy-horny.</font>

404
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,144
<font color="#ffff00">- Okay. Okay.
- I mean,</font>

405
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:26,518
<font color="#ffff00">if I even get a whiff of Ramsey,
it's like I just have to pounce, you know?</font>

406
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,182
<font color="#ffff00">And I gotta give this old boy credit.</font>

407
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:32,524
<font color="#ffff00">He's still got that race car engine
that can go the distance.</font>

408
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,755
<font color="#ffff00">- Hormones. What're you gonna do?
- Yeah. Yeah.</font>

409
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,801
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know.
Maybe not talk about it at brunch?</font>

410
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,995
<font color="#ffff00">- Yep, that's what I'd do.
- That's what I'd do, too.</font>

411
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,731
<font color="#ffff00">We're on the same page on that one.</font>

412
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,670
<font color="#ffff00">Honey, I know you can't have any</font>

413
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:46,675
<font color="#ffff00">- so I'm gonna do one for you and the baby.
- The baby!</font>

414
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,070
<font color="#ffff00">Sweet.</font>

415
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:52,471
<font color="#ffff00">- Here's to the Coopers.
- Yeah, you know what, what the hell.</font>

416
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,175
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

417
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,948
<font color="#ffff00">Well, that was delicious.</font>

418
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,784
<font color="#ffff00">Honey, I didn't make any of it.
You know Ramsey don't want me cooking.</font>

419
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,482
<font color="#ffff00">- Your mom and I...
- Not my mom.</font>

420
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,321
<font color="#ffff00">We sure wish y'all could stay longer.</font>

421
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,125
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. That's the thing. It's such a bummer,</font>

422
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:08,892
<font color="#ffff00">but the missus
and little Mini Cooper and I,</font>

423
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,160
<font color="#ffff00">we have an appointment.</font>

424
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,997
<font color="#ffff00">- Yes, at...
- Walmart.</font>

425
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,536
<font color="#ffff00">- For paint.
- Yeah. And mulch.</font>

426
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:17,665
<font color="#ffff00">Well, you know what they say.
Money isn't everything,</font>

427
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,970
<font color="#ffff00">but sure keeps you connected to your kids.</font>

428
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,776
<font color="#ffff00">- So how much you need?
- Dad, I don't need any money.</font>

429
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,312
<font color="#ffff00">- I don't need any money.
- Come on. How much you need?</font>

430
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,473
<font color="#ffff00">No, I don't need anything at all.
Thank you so much.</font>

431
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,709
<font color="#ffff00">- Man pats.
- Man pats, that's great.</font>

432
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,252
<font color="#ffff00">Come here, baby, give your mama a kiss.</font>

433
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:30,479
<font color="#ffff00">- What?
- Okay...</font>

434
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,146
<font color="#ffff00">- Baby.
- Okay.</font>

435
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,816
<font color="#ffff00">My baby boy. I'm so proud of you.
You've grown up so fast.</font>

436
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,882
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, Gary. Gar.</font>

437
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:38,359
<font color="#ffff00">- What? Yeah.
- Okay.</font>

438
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,589
<font color="#ffff00">- Awesome. This was so much...
- All right. We'll see y'all later.</font>

439
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,633
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, great, this was a thing, you know?</font>

440
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,565
<font color="#ffff00">- Congratulations!
- Yeah, congrats.</font>

441
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,332
<font color="#ffff00">- Come back soon!
- Don't ever kiss her again.</font>

442
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,468
<font color="#ffff00">Well...</font>

443
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,371
<font color="#ffff00">Okay. Are you sure you took the test right?</font>

444
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,808
<font color="#ffff00">You pee on a stick. It's idiot-proof.</font>

445
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,181
<font color="#ffff00">No, I know. It's just, you know, one time.</font>

446
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,275
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

447
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,120
<font color="#ffff00">So what do you want to do?</font>

448
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,461
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know.</font>

449
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,563
<font color="#ffff00">What do you want to do?</font>

450
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,423
<font color="#ffff00">Look, I don't know.</font>

451
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:21,733
<font color="#ffff00">I just found out, okay? You're the girl.
Don't you get to decide?</font>

452
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,704
<font color="#ffff00">Great, great. So then it's all on me?</font>

453
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,764
<font color="#ffff00">No. No, I didn't mean...</font>

454
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,474
<font color="#ffff00">Shit. Should we get married?</font>

455
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:34,174
<font color="#ffff00">"Shit. Should we get married?" Yeah.</font>

456
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,249
<font color="#ffff00">No, it's just,
when you put it like that, that's...</font>

457
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,448
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry, Rosie.
I'm just trying to do the right thing here.</font>

458
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,321
<font color="#ffff00">- I didn't mean to...
- Then don't ask the wrong questions.</font>

459
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,455
<font color="#ffff00">- Just forget that I said anything.
- No.</font>

460
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:49,897
<font color="#ffff00">Just forget it 'cause I'll figure it out.
Whatever it is, it's not your problem.</font>

461
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,194
<font color="#ffff00">- Rosie!
- It's fine.</font>

462
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,792
<font color="#ffff00">I have to get back to the truck anyway.</font>

463
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,346
<font color="#ffff00">There he is!</font>

464
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:08,176
<font color="#ffff00">Perfect. Okay, guys, look right here.</font>

465
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,242
<font color="#ffff00">Big smile.</font>

466
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,550
<font color="#ffff00">Aristotle! Good smile!</font>

467
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,759
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, beautiful. You can pick up your prints
at the kiosk at the front.</font>

468
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:20,589
<font color="#ffff00">All right, everyone.
Aristotle needs his down time.</font>

469
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:22,526
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, can we all wave bye-bye?</font>

470
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,298
<font color="#ffff00">Bye!</font>

471
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,102
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you, nice friend.</font>

472
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,135
<font color="#ffff00">So, how's Alex? Is he excited?</font>

473
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,070
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah! Yeah! He's...</font>

474
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:33,769
<font color="#ffff00">No. Actually, he's... I don't know.</font>

475
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,073
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know. Maybe he's just not ready.</font>

476
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:38,136
<font color="#ffff00">- They're never ready.
- Yeah.</font>

477
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,274
<font color="#ffff00">Dude's group.</font>

478
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,681
<font color="#ffff00">- What?
- Dude's group.</font>

479
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,310
<font color="#ffff00"><i>It's like Fight Club,</i></font>

480
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,719
<font color="#ffff00">only there's no fighting,
everybody has babies,</font>

481
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,814
<font color="#ffff00">they don't talk about what they do there.</font>

482
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,881
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know what they do there
and I don't need to know.</font>

483
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:52,895
<font color="#ffff00">All I know is that Craig started going
when I was pregnant with Henri</font>

484
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:55,022
<font color="#ffff00">- and he's losing his shit.
- Yeah.</font>

485
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:58,795
<font color="#ffff00">Now, he loves being a dad
and he never misses a Saturday.</font>

486
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,770
<font color="#ffff00">You want Alex ready?
Send him to the dudes.</font>

487
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,465
<font color="#ffff00">Your blood pressure is low
and you are in good health.</font>

488

<font color="#ffff00">- And Dad's gonna keep you that way, right?
- Right.</font>

489
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,377
<font color="#ffff00">- Look at these pamphlets.
- Thank you.</font>

490
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,540
<font color="#ffff00">That's all we need to know.
Let's not go crazy with the research.</font>

491
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,777
<font color="#ffff00">I love research. It soothes me.</font>

492
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:18,082
<font color="#ffff00">Well then, you'll love the wall.
I'll see you both in a month.</font>

493
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,849
<font color="#ffff00">Wow!</font>

494
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,754
<font color="#ffff00">- Look at the wall!
- No, no, no, no.</font>

495
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:24,020
<font color="#ffff00">I don't want to know about
everything that can go wrong.</font>

496
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,527
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, my God! Look at this.</font>

497
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,359
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, there's breast-feeding,
we have to know about this.</font>

498
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,724
<font color="#ffff00">Cord-blood-banking,
this is very important these days.</font>

499
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,997
<font color="#ffff00">You need to learn the Bradley Method.
And... What?</font>

500
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,265
<font color="#ffff00">"Circumcision: Yes or No?"</font>

501
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,500
<font color="#ffff00">Of course. How is that even a question?</font>

502
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,600
<font color="#ffff00">Actually, a lot of couples are choosing
not to circumcise these days.</font>

503
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,602
<font color="#ffff00">- Interesting.
- Who said that?</font>

504
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,113
<font color="#ffff00">The expert, honey.
So clearly, there's a question.</font>

505
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,583
<font color="#ffff00">- That's why it says "Yes or No?"
- My answer is "Yes." Yes! Yes!</font>

506
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:50,846
<font color="#ffff00">- My answer is, "I need to read about it."
- No more...</font>

507
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,851
<font color="#ffff00">See you tomorrow, okay?</font>

508
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:03,325
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not gonna forget it.</font>

509
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,300
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Can I get a "I can do it”? You can do it!</i></font>

510

511
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,973
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, my God.
Damn, this show gives me the munchies.</font>

512
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:15,306
<font color="#ffff00"><i>This is the beginning of the rest of your life!</i></font>

513
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,074
<font color="#ffff00">I so wanna do that slide-y thing.</font>

514
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,910
<font color="#ffff00">I feel so bad, but it's hilarious.</font>

515
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,349
<font color="#ffff00">- No, no, this is just so funny.
- I hope they're having fun.</font>

516
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:26,982
<font color="#ffff00">- Hi.
- Hi.</font>

517

- And vice-versa.</font>

519

Not "Hot Marco."</font>

520
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,430
<font color="#ffff00">Well done, Rosie.</font>

521
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,162
<font color="#ffff00">- Well done.
- You said I was cute?</font>

522
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:40,669
<font color="#ffff00">- Ignore them.
- Yeah, we did.</font>

523
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,669
<font color="#ffff00">So, you're going, right?</font>

524
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,604
<font color="#ffff00">No, I'm not. I've already got friends.</font>

525
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,540
<font color="#ffff00">- But these guys all have babies.
- Yeah. That sounds terrible.</font>

526
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:51,039
<font color="#ffff00">Craig goes. You like Craig.</font>

527
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:54,015
<font color="#ffff00">I tolerate Craig at a barbecue.
Not as a forced play date.</font>

528
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:01,520
<font color="#ffff00">- If you go, just once...
- Holly, I am trying to work here, okay?</font>

529
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:05,419
<font color="#ffff00">- Oh, my God!
- I'll give you one right here, right now.</font>

530
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:07,729
<font color="#ffff00">Really?</font>

531
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,493
<font color="#ffff00">- Right here, right now?
- Yes.</font>

532
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,339
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, Craig.</font>

533
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:33,712
<font color="#ffff00">Alex, Vic. Vic, Alex.</font>

534
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:35,746
<font color="#ffff00">Welcome to Happy Hour.</font>

535
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:37,411
<font color="#ffff00">Let's walk.</font>

536
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:44,322
<font color="#ffff00">I sense your fear, Alex. It's cool.</font>

537
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:45,888
<font color="#ffff00">You're still on the other side.</font>

538
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,858
<font color="#ffff00">Stay on that side, Alex.</font>

539
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,626
<font color="#ffff00">This is the side
where happiness goes to die.</font>

540
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,257
<font color="#ffff00">Don't mind Craig. He's had a bad week.</font>

541
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:55,600
<font color="#ffff00">Kara just took a three-day business trip
and little Henry there just got sick.</font>

542
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,597
<font color="#ffff00">- Here you go, big boy. Walk it off.
- Thanks.</font>

543
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:02,406
<font color="#ffff00">By the way, when we're around Kara,
it's still "Henri." "Henry's" on the DL.</font>

544
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,707
<font color="#ffff00">- Henri.
- You got that, Alex?</font>

545
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,771
<font color="#ffff00">It's very important. That's the first rule.</font>

546
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,249
<font color="#ffff00">- Don't talk about what we walk about.
- Rule #1.</font>

547
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,411
<font color="#ffff00">Got it.</font>

548
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,684
<font color="#ffff00">See, Alex, women pretty much control
the baby universe. And why not?</font>

549
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,954
<font color="#ffff00">They carried the damn things,
pushed them outta their vaginae.</font>

550
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,791
<font color="#ffff00">I never used to use that word
for that part of the body but, trust me,</font>

551
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:22,262
<font color="#ffff00">once a baby comes out of it, it's a vagina.</font>

552
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,626
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah!
- Lt changes.</font>

553
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:26,635
<font color="#ffff00">Here, we're free.
No one's looking over your shoulder.</font>

554
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,399
<font color="#ffff00">If you put the diaper on backwards
or forget to heat the bottle up,</font>

555
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,972
<font color="#ffff00">you go with it.</font>

556
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:33,668
<font color="#ffff00">If you wanna ditch those carrot sticks
and feed your kid McNuggets</font>

557
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,005
<font color="#ffff00">- you go for it.
- Who cares?</font>

558
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,204
<font color="#ffff00">And if your wife named your kid Henri</font>

559
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,339
<font color="#ffff00">and you wanna ignore
that silent-H bullshit...</font>

560
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,975
<font color="#ffff00">- Bullshit!
- ...you're in a safe place. What's up, Henry!</font>

561
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,348
<font color="#ffff00">- Good to know.
- Henri. What is he, a mime?</font>

562
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:46,585
<font color="#ffff00">Where does "Henri" come from anyway?</font>

563
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,885
<font color="#ffff00"><i>- Cirque du Soleil.</i>
<i>- So dumb.</i></font>

564
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,624
<font color="#ffff00">It looks like
you've got your hands full there.</font>

565
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,890
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, I got four under five.</font>

566
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:58,232
<font color="#ffff00">One more, we can run a full court.
Two more and I got pallbearers.</font>

567
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:02,904
<font color="#ffff00">I got Evander here. Venus and Jeter
are my twins, and my main man Jordan.</font>

568
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:07,834
<font color="#ffff00">Sure, twice a year, I think about the price
of college and cry in my car for a half hour.</font>

569
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:10,709
<font color="#ffff00">But then I punch myself in the dick
and get over it.</font>

570
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:13,339
<font color="#ffff00">- I can go for four more.
- Really?</font>

571
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:14,644
<font color="#ffff00">Come on, Jordan. Keep up.</font>

572
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,485
<font color="#ffff00">Craig, do you have some sunscreen?</font>

573
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,386
<font color="#ffff00">Relax. Sunburn is full of vitamin D.</font>

574
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:23,084
<font color="#ffff00">- Guys! It's Davis!
- Totally!</font>

575
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,316
<font color="#ffff00">- D-Bone!
- Hey, big guy!</font>

576
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:26,588
<font color="#ffff00">Fellas.</font>

577
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:27,823
<font color="#ffff00">What's up, bro?</font>

578
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,192
<font color="#ffff00">Offspring. New guy.</font>

579
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,291
<font color="#ffff00">What's up, man?</font>

580
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,927
<font color="#ffff00">- Everybody good?
- Yeah, man.</font>

581
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,836
<font color="#ffff00">So, D-Biscuit, haven't seen you
hanging around. Where you been?</font>

582
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,774
<font color="#ffff00">- Costa Rica, bro.
- Central America, classic.</font>

583
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:40,866
<font color="#ffff00">I had to do some work.</font>

584
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,036
<font color="#ffff00">- Really?
- Working it.</font>

585
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:45,012
<font color="#ffff00">- "Work!"
- This lucky bastard's a surf photographer,</font>

586
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,878

- Sweet.</font>

587
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:49,113
<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

588
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:53,121
<font color="#ffff00">Costa Rica.</font>

589
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,984
<font color="#ffff00">The mountains of Costa Rica.</font>

590
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,654
<font color="#ffff00">Whoa! Whoa!</font>

591
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,024
<font color="#ffff00">That's classified.</font>

592
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,464
<font color="#ffff00">Gotta watch it, Davis.
That one looks like a wife.</font>

593
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:05,592
<font color="#ffff00">She got "wife eyes."</font>

594
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,335
<font color="#ffff00">"Girlfriend tits," but definitely "wife eyes."</font>

595
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,600
<font color="#ffff00">I've got to get better pictures on my phone.</font>

596
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,039
<font color="#ffff00">Your phone ain't the problem, bro.</font>

597
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,667
<font color="#ffff00">Come on. You guys are the ones
living the real dream.</font>

598
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,734
<font color="#ffff00">I will Freaky Friday with you anytime.</font>

599
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,778
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, Patel, what's the Camaro situation?</font>

600
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,249
<font color="#ffff00">- You ready to sell that bad boy or what?
- Never.</font>

601
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,445
<font color="#ffff00">- Never?
- Yeah.</font>

602
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,317
<font color="#ffff00">Ask him when was the last time he drove it.</font>

603
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:26,821
<font color="#ffff00">Plus, you can't even get
a car seat in that thing.</font>

604
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,855
<font color="#ffff00">Patel's wife wants him to trade in
his '69 Camaro.</font>

605
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:32,252
<font color="#ffff00">We have bets on how long he can last.</font>

606
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:35,821
<font color="#ffff00">Gabriel, I understand you've embraced
the minivan, and that's your journey,</font>

607
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:39,528
<font color="#ffff00">but I don't want to drive a vagina on wheels.</font>

608
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:42,636
<font color="#ffff00">My vagina seats seven, comfortably.</font>

609
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,105
<font color="#ffff00">I've been in it a million times.</font>

610
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,870
<font color="#ffff00">Plus, Patel test drove a minivan
last week anyway.</font>

611
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,410
<font color="#ffff00">- What?
- So?</font>

612
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:49,838
<font color="#ffff00">That doesn't mean anything!</font>

613
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:52,245
<font color="#ffff00">I look at houses with Holly,
but we're not buying one.</font>

614
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,175
<font color="#ffff00">- Bro, bro, bro.
- What?</font>

615
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,880
<font color="#ffff00">When your wife says
you're just test driving minivans,</font>

617

you're just looking at houses,</font>

Can I just borrow Alex for two secs?</font>

00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:43,937
<font color="#ffff00">How much more?</font>

755
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,776
<font color="#ffff00">A tip more.</font>

768
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,840

<font color="#ffff00">My woman gave birth doggie-style.</font>

778
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:48,476
<font color="#ffff00">And then out is gonna slide a little miracle.</font>

779
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:52,639
<font color="#ffff00">Half you, half her, your DNA all mixed
together in one magical baby cocktail.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, do it that way. No fuss, no muss.</font>

783
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,014
<font color="#ffff00">Come on, Jordan!</font>

784
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,454
<font color="#ffff00">- What if he hates me?
- He will.</font>

785
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:08,395
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, what if he tries to kill me
in my sleep when he's 15?</font>

786
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,261
<font color="#ffff00">Well, then I guess
you're not a very good father.</font>

787
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:12,300
<font color="#ffff00">That's normal.
That's like every Greek tragedy.</font>

788
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:13,494
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah.
- Come on, guys.</font>

789
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,366
<font color="#ffff00">I'm serious, okay? I need help.</font>

790
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:16,596
<font color="#ffff00">Dude, you're gonna be fine.</font>

791
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,936
<font color="#ffff00">You've just got to get over
your fear of babies. They can smell fear.</font>

792
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:20,839
<font color="#ffff00">Like bears or wives.</font>

793
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,707
<font color="#ffff00">You need some practice.
Here, hold Henry for a second.</font>

794
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,006
<font color="#ffff00">- No, no, no, no, no!
- Do not do that.</font>

795
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,105
<font color="#ffff00">- Do not touch his baby!
- Shut up!</font>

796
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,207
<font color="#ffff00">That kid is a grenade, and he will go off.</font>

797
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,548
<font color="#ffff00">You know what, start with Evander here.
She never cries.</font>

798
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:31,778
<font color="#ffff00">No, I'm cool, thank you.</font>

799
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:34,220
<font color="#ffff00">She fell off the changing table last week,
didn't make a sound.</font>

800
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:36,752
<font color="#ffff00">You dropped your kid off a changing table?</font>

801
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,018
<font color="#ffff00">How was that even possible?</font>

802
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:40,286
<font color="#ffff00">It's very possible.</font>

803
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,355
<font color="#ffff00">It's much more common than you think
But you know what? Rule number two..</font>

804
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,922
<font color="#ffff00">- We don't judge.
- No judging.</font>

805
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,626
<font color="#ffff00">Stuff just happens, okay?
Last week my kid ate a cigarette.</font>

806
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,672
<font color="#ffff00">I caught him playing in the dryer yesterday.</font>

807
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:52,139
<font color="#ffff00">I picked up the wrong baby from day care.</font>

808
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:53,903
<font color="#ffff00">Found my baby swimming in the toilet.</font>

809
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:57,343
<font color="#ffff00">And for the record,
the roll-off did not happen on my watch.</font>

810
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,381
<font color="#ffff00">- Dodged a bullet.
- No judging.</font>

811
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:01,882
<font color="#ffff00">- Come on. Come on.
- No, really, that's okay.</font>

812
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:04,044
<font color="#ffff00">- Come on. Come on. Here you go!
- That's all right.</font>

813
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:05,753
<font color="#ffff00">Good catch.</font>

814
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:08,646
<font color="#ffff00">Take her back.</font>

815
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:09,847
<font color="#ffff00">Take her back!</font>

816
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:12,720
<font color="#ffff00">I hope that adoption agency
has a return policy.</font>

817
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:15,161
<font color="#ffff00">Big help, guys. Glad I came out.</font>

818
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,363
<font color="#ffff00">It's Davis!</font>

819
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,298
<font color="#ffff00">Davis! Davis! Davis!</font>

820
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:22,371
<font color="#ffff00">- Yeah, bro!
- D-Bone!</font>

821
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:23,563
<font color="#ffff00">- What is up?
- Boom.</font>

822
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:26,574
<font color="#ffff00">S'up fellas, kids, Jordan!</font>

823
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:31,268
<font color="#ffff00">Dude, this kid is like Mickey Rourke
in The Wrestler.</font>

824
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:34,881
<font color="#ffff00">I wish he was that well behaved.
He's more like Mickey Rourke in real life.</font>

825
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:37,947
<font color="#ffff00">So tall.</font>

826
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,544
<font color="#ffff00">- Been working out?
- Yeah.</font>

827
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:43,251
<font color="#ffff00">I missed out on high fives before.
I'll take one if you had a spare.</font>

828
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:46,958
<font color="#ffff00">- I got you, Craig.
- Thank you.</font>

829
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:49,491
<font color="#ffff00">- Sorry, Davis.
- All right, I'm out of here.</font>

830
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:53,701
<font color="#ffff00">Nice job, Craig.</font>

831
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,588
<font color="#ffff00">Kara, what time is it?</font>

832
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:23,196
<font color="#ffff00">I've got 20 minutes to make it
to the crib sale at Babies "R" Us.</font>

833
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,530
<font color="#ffff00">I've been totally cracking out on baby stuff.</font>

834
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:29,227
<font color="#ffff00">Sneaker-socks.
I've got my 2-in-1 swing rocker.</font>

835
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:33,701
<font color="#ffff00">What is with the face?</font>

836
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:36,108
<font color="#ffff00">Holly, I'm sorry to tell you this</font>

837
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,977
<font color="#ffff00">but we just had our budget meeting,</font>

838
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:41,141
<font color="#ffff00">and I don't know
that we're renewing your contract.</font>

839
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:45,643
<font color="#ffff00">I've got to cut down on all my freelancers.
You were the last one hired.</font>

840
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,724
<font color="#ffff00">Wait. But this is my main job.</font>

841
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:53,450
<font color="#ffff00">We're about to close on the house.</font>

842
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:58,427
<font color="#ffff00">I'm doing what I can to keep you,
but it just isn't looking good.</font>

843
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:11,907
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

844
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:13,539
<font color="#ffff00">- Don't hate me.
- No.</font>

845
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:19,746
<font color="#ffff00">Do me a favor?</font>

846
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:24,021
<font color="#ffff00">Don't tell Alex
until I can find something else. Okay?</font>

847
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:25,651
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

848
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:27,924
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

849
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:29,687
<font color="#ffff00">- I'm sorry.
- No.</font>

850
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:35,235
<font color="#ffff00">And reach! And push.
Okay now, break starfish formation.</font>

851
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,501
<font color="#ffff00">Let's get back in position.
I want opposite sets. Crunch it up.</font>

852
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:40,769
<font color="#ffff00">I want 10 of those on each side.
That's 20, people.</font>

853
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:43,468
<font color="#ffff00">And I need a minute.
And don't think I won't be watching you.</font>

854
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:44,638
<font color="#ffff00">Keep it moving.</font>

855
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:49,581
<font color="#ffff00">"I'm Not Circumcising My Baby."
Well done. Well done. Front page.</font>

856
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,019
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, look, I was gonna tell you
I did not say this to them.</font>

857
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:56,353
<font color="#ffff00">They overheard our private conversation
I would never talk to them about us.</font>

858
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,823
<font color="#ffff00">Why is this such a big deal to you?</font>

859
00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:00,384
<font color="#ffff00">Because I don't think that it's right.
And I'm his mother.</font>

860
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:03,522
<font color="#ffff00">And I'm his father.
Parenthood is about compromise.</font>

861
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:05,430
<font color="#ffff00">- Well, then compromise, Evan.
- I have.</font>

862
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:08,501
<font color="#ffff00">I stay at your place.
We spend the holidays with your family.</font>

863
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:11,103
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, but I have sacrificed
my entire body for this.</font>

864
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,902
<font color="#ffff00">So that means
you just get to win every argument?</font>

865
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:15,534
<font color="#ffff00">No, that means that in every relationship...</font>

866
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,079
<font color="#ffff00">What are you guys doing?
Come on! Pick it up!</font>

867
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:21,909
<font color="#ffff00">In every relationship,
there's an alpha and a beta.</font>

868
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,076

- And I'm the alpha.</font>

869
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,177
<font color="#ffff00">- No, I'm the alpha. No, I am!
- No, I'm the alpha. No, I am!</font>

stay at my place tonight.</font>

How are you feeling?</font>

914
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:09,877

she got herpes.</font>

Not from being pregnant.</font>

With all this life running through me.</font>

921
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:35,336
<font color="#ffff00">I felt the exact same way
when I had my phantom pregnancy.</font>

922
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:38,137
<font color="#ffff00">Don't pay attention to her.</font>

923
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:41,845
<font color="#ffff00">But, yeah, I mean, I just... It's beautiful.</font>

You know exactly what this is like.</font>

a magical pregnancy unicorn.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Wow! Thanks. That's super-supportive.
I appreciate that.</font>

supposed to mention reality?</font>

960

Not that you're helping me any.</font>

in a moment of weakness.</font>

967
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,060
<font color="#ffff00">Honestly, God, seriously, I sometimes think</font>

968

<font color="#ffff00">that it would just be so much easier
if I could do this on my own.</font>

agree on everything?</font>

973
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:58,115
<font color="#ffff00">Fine. Why don't you make every decision
about our child's entire life</font>

974
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,655
<font color="#ffff00">and just send me an email

and not "Holy shit, we can't afford our life."</font>

1038
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:47,389
<font color="#ffff00">You know, I know you've been
so worried about saving and the house...</font>

1039
00:56:47,448 --> 00:56:49,052
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, we're in this together.</font>

1040
00:56:49,117 --> 00:56:51,358
<font color="#ffff00">Here I am,
trying to get ready for something that's...</font>

1041
00:56:51,419 --> 00:56:52,523
<font color="#ffff00">Oh. my God!</font>

1042
00:56:52,587 --> 00:56:54,294
<font color="#ffff00">- What?
- I knew it.</font>

1043
00:56:54,355 --> 00:56:55,527
<font color="#ffff00">You're not even ready?</font>

1044
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:57,501
<font color="#ffff00">Look, I'm not like you, okay?</font>

1045
00:56:57,558 --> 00:57:00,664
<font color="#ffff00">I can't just look at a picture
and feel some magical bond.</font>

1046
00:57:00,728 --> 00:57:02,503
<font color="#ffff00">And you lying to me isn't helping.</font>

1047
00:57:02,563 --> 00:57:05,669
<font color="#ffff00">- Look, I know, okay? I screwed up.
- Yeah. You did.</font>

1048
00:57:07,869 --> 00:57:09,405
<font color="#ffff00">I just...</font>

1049
00:57:11,539 --> 00:57:15,578
<font color="#ffff00">I just couldn't handle
another thing being my fault.</font>

1050
00:57:16,711 --> 00:57:18,782
<font color="#ffff00">Okay? I'm the one with the bad eggs.</font>

1051
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:23,322
<font color="#ffff00">I'm the one who made us spend
the 401K money on IVF.</font>

1052
00:57:25,052 --> 00:57:30,024
<font color="#ffff00">And I'm the one who can't do the one thing
a woman is supposed to be able to do.</font>

1053
00:57:30,224 --> 00:57:33,262
<font color="#ffff00">Holly, that's enough. Stop it.</font>

1054
00:57:44,172 --> 00:57:46,311
<font color="#ffff00">You don't even want this, do you?</font>

1055
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:48,577
<font color="#ffff00">I never said that.</font>

1056
00:57:49,744 --> 00:57:51,485
<font color="#ffff00">Not out loud.</font>

1057
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,157
<font color="#ffff00">I can't believe you didn't tell him.</font>

1058
00:57:55,116 --> 00:57:57,323
<font color="#ffff00">You know what? Glass houses, Craig!</font>

1059
00:57:58,052 --> 00:58:01,932
<font color="#ffff00">I know all about how you call your son
"Henry" when Kara's not around.</font>

1060
00:58:01,989 --> 00:58:04,299
<font color="#ffff00">- Holly, let's go. Let's go.
- You what?</font>

1061
00:58:04,959 --> 00:58:06,961
<font color="#ffff00">You don't like the name "Henri"?</font>

1062
00:58:07,028 --> 00:58:11,704
<font color="#ffff00">That is such a bold-faced lie!
He's obviously joking!</font>

1063
00:58:12,099 --> 00:58:13,669
<font color="#ffff00">Guess who's not getting any tonight?</font>

1064
00:58:13,868 --> 00:58:14,938
<font color="#ffff00">First rule, Alex!</font>

1065
00:58:15,369 --> 00:58:19,283
<font color="#ffff00">An obvious joke that Latins with their Latin,
spicy Latin sense of humor...</font>

1066
00:58:19,373 --> 00:58:20,909
<font color="#ffff00">You've seen Univision. He was kidding.</font>

1067
00:58:20,975 --> 00:58:23,285
<font color="#ffff00">When you look like him, you can have</font>

1068
00:58:23,344 --> 00:58:25,756
<font color="#ffff00">- a spicy sense of humor, stupid! All right?
- Get in the car.</font>

1069
00:58:25,813 --> 00:58:27,656
<font color="#ffff00">- He was obviously kidding.
- You get in the car!</font>

1070
00:58:27,715 --> 00:58:29,422
<font color="#ffff00">Don't you talk to me like that!</font>

1071
00:58:29,984 --> 00:58:31,861
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, my God, I am so sorry.</font>

1072
00:58:31,919 --> 00:58:33,865
<font color="#ffff00">- Do not touch me.
- I love you so much.</font>

1073
00:58:33,921 --> 00:58:36,333
<font color="#ffff00">- Shut up. I don't want to hear it.
- I love you so much.</font>

1074
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:37,869
<font color="#ffff00">Stop talking!</font>

1075
00:58:40,628 --> 00:58:42,801
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, here we are in Atlanta, Georgia.</font>

1076
00:58:42,863 --> 00:58:46,037
<font color="#ffff00">Home of one of the audience favorites
from Season 4.</font>

1077
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,545
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, we're popping in on him</font>

1078
00:58:47,602 --> 00:58:50,276
<font color="#ffff00">and see how he's maintaining his weight
and healthy lifestyle.</font>

1079
00:58:50,338 --> 00:58:51,749
<font color="#ffff00">Here we go.</font>

1080
00:58:51,806 --> 00:58:53,285
<font color="#ffff00">Drop the pig, Gary Cooper!</font>

1081
00:58:53,341 --> 00:58:54,649
<font color="#ffff00">- What?
- That's right.</font>

1082
00:58:54,709 --> 00:58:56,245
<font color="#ffff00">Jules! Oh, my...</font>

1083
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:57,516
<font color="#ffff00">- It's a documentary?
- Hi!</font>

1084
00:58:57,578 --> 00:58:59,888
<font color="#ffff00">- No. It's a real thing. It's live.
- What do we got there?</font>

1085
00:58:59,947 --> 00:59:03,087
<font color="#ffff00">This isn't actually for me.
I was just picking this up for a friend.</font>

1086
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:05,255
<font color="#ffff00">Remember this guy? See that guy?</font>

1087
00:59:05,586 --> 00:59:07,088
<font color="#ffff00">- You remember him?
- Oh, jeez.</font>

1088
00:59:07,154 --> 00:59:09,134
<font color="#ffff00">This is a one-time thing. It's a treat.</font>

1089
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:10,897
<font color="#ffff00">That's what I thought you might say.</font>

1090
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:13,029
<font color="#ffff00">We've been doing a little recon on you.</font>

1091
00:59:13,094 --> 00:59:15,335
<font color="#ffff00">- Nice sweater, by the way.
- Thank you.</font>

1092
00:59:15,396 --> 00:59:17,569
<font color="#ffff00">My wife is pregnant, Jules, okay?</font>

1093
00:59:17,632 --> 00:59:21,774
<font color="#ffff00">And you know, it's really common for guys
to put on a little weight as their wife does.</font>

1094
00:59:21,836 --> 00:59:24,407
<font color="#ffff00">It's called "Couvade Syndrome"
or "Sympathetic Pregnancy."</font>

1095
00:59:24,472 --> 00:59:26,383
<font color="#ffff00">No. It's called a crutch, Gary.</font>

1096
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,716
<font color="#ffff00">Come on. We need to deal with
what the real issue is.</font>

1097
00:59:28,776 --> 00:59:31,757
<font color="#ffff00">You need to deal with it today,
not 100 pounds from now.</font>

1098
00:59:31,846 --> 00:59:33,154
<font color="#ffff00">Do you wanna be this guy again?</font>

1099
00:59:33,514 --> 00:59:34,584
<font color="#ffff00">Could we stop this, please?</font>

1100
00:59:34,649 --> 00:59:36,390
<font color="#ffff00">Because you don't even understand
what I'm talking about.</font>

1101
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:39,021
<font color="#ffff00">- I don't understand?
- It's not an issue you have in your life.</font>

1102
00:59:39,086 --> 00:59:40,827
<font color="#ffff00">- Stop it.
- Ever since I've had this belly</font>

1103
00:59:41,122 --> 00:59:43,864
<font color="#ffff00">people think it's okay,
not just to have an opinion about me</font>

1104
00:59:43,924 --> 00:59:46,165
<font color="#ffff00">but to have an opinion about my baby.</font>

1105
00:59:46,227 --> 00:59:49,401
<font color="#ffff00">Seriously, in what world
is it okay for a complete stranger</font>

1106
00:59:49,463 --> 00:59:52,376
<font color="#ffff00">to comment on my son's penis
before he's even born?</font>

1107
00:59:52,933 --> 00:59:56,847
<font color="#ffff00">Jesus! Somebody, anybody,
please ask me what I'm craving.</font>

1108
00:59:58,506 --> 00:59:59,610
<font color="#ffff00">What are you craving?</font>

1109
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:01,645
<font color="#ffff00">That looks pretty good.</font>

1110
01:00:01,842 --> 01:00:03,651
<font color="#ffff00">They are really good.</font>

1111
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,985
<font color="#ffff00">They're not good for you,
but they're really good.</font>

1112
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,559
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, we can cut that part out.
Are we still rolling? We good?</font>

1113
01:00:08,649 --> 01:00:09,855
<font color="#ffff00">We good? Okay, here we go.</font>

1114
01:00:09,917 --> 01:00:13,455
<font color="#ffff00">We are gonna deal with this issue, Gary,
in a very healthy way.</font>

1115
01:00:13,521 --> 01:00:16,092
<font color="#ffff00">- Okay
- I wanna hear you say, "I can do it!"</font>

1116
01:00:16,157 --> 01:00:17,693
<font color="#ffff00">- Just like you did in Season 4.
- Okay.</font>

1117
01:00:17,758 --> 01:00:19,999
<font color="#ffff00">- I wanna hear it. Say it! "I can do it!"
- I can do it!</font>

1118
01:00:20,061 --> 01:00:21,540
<font color="#ffff00">- I can do it! I can do it!
- I can do it!</font>

1119
01:00:21,595 --> 01:00:23,700
<font color="#ffff00">- You and I are gonna do it together, Gary.
- Okay!</font>

1120
01:00:23,764 --> 01:00:25,675
<font color="#ffff00">You and I, here we go.
We're gonna do lunges. Ready?</font>

1121
01:00:25,733 --> 01:00:28,873
<font color="#ffff00">And I want it deep, to the knee,
and squeeze back up.</font>

1122
01:00:28,936 --> 01:00:30,006
<font color="#ffff00">One more. Come on in.</font>

1123
01:00:30,237 --> 01:00:31,409
<font color="#ffff00">Let's go.</font>

1124
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,843
<font color="#ffff00">- Jules! Oh, my God! Are you okay?
- Oh, my God!</font>

1125
01:00:35,042 --> 01:00:37,352
<font color="#ffff00">- Are you okay?
- No! I'm okay. Oh, my God!</font>

1126
01:00:37,545 --> 01:00:40,185
<font color="#ffff00">- Gary. Someone's gotta call 9-1-1.
- Okay, yeah.</font>

1127
01:00:40,281 --> 01:00:41,316
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, God! No!</font>

1128
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:50,425
<font color="#ffff00">What's up, guys?</font>

1129
01:00:53,027 --> 01:00:56,600
<font color="#ffff00">Guys! Hey! Whoa, whoa! Wait up.</font>

1130
01:00:56,764 --> 01:00:59,267
<font color="#ffff00">Freeze! Don't take another step!</font>

1131
01:00:59,867 --> 01:01:03,405
<font color="#ffff00">You told your wife
Craig likes to call Henri "Henry"?</font>

1132
01:01:03,671 --> 01:01:07,209
<font color="#ffff00">- She did not take it well.
- Okay, my bad, my bad. I'm sorry.</font>

1133
01:01:07,441 --> 01:01:10,047
<font color="#ffff00">We're here to let off a little steam.
Not break up families.</font>

1134
01:01:10,711 --> 01:01:14,557
<font color="#ffff00">Craig shouldn't have to see his kids only
on weekends 'cause you got a big mouth.</font>

1135
01:01:14,615 --> 01:01:16,754
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.</font>

1136
01:01:16,817 --> 01:01:18,160
<font color="#ffff00">Darn right you weren't thinking.</font>

1137
01:01:18,819 --> 01:01:21,561
<font color="#ffff00">You wanna adopt? Adopt some new friends.</font>

1138
01:01:21,756 --> 01:01:23,497
<font color="#ffff00">Come on, guys. Really?</font>

1139
01:01:23,724 --> 01:01:25,294
<font color="#ffff00">Unbelievable!</font>

1140
01:01:27,928 --> 01:01:30,067
<font color="#ffff00">Craig! Come on, Craig!</font>

1141
01:01:30,164 --> 01:01:32,838
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, don't think
that I won't punch you in the neck</font>

1142
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,243
<font color="#ffff00">just 'cause I have an infant strapped to me.</font>

1143
01:01:34,301 --> 01:01:38,147
<font color="#ffff00">- I still have full range of motion.
- Look, I'm in crisis here. All right?</font>

1144
01:01:39,807 --> 01:01:41,946
<font color="#ffff00">We had to pull out of the house.</font>

1145
01:01:42,009 --> 01:01:45,149
<font color="#ffff00">Now Holly won't even talk to me.
She thinks I don't want the baby.</font>

1146
01:01:45,346 --> 01:01:46,654
<font color="#ffff00">Well, do you?</font>

1147
01:01:47,114 --> 01:01:48,354
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

1148
01:01:48,682 --> 01:01:49,854
<font color="#ffff00">Really?</font>

1149
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:54,798
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, I don't know. I don't know.</font>

1150
01:01:55,289 --> 01:01:59,294
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, you said
this is where happiness goes to die.</font>

1151
01:01:59,427 --> 01:02:00,906
<font color="#ffff00">Henry cries if you touch him.</font>

1152
01:02:01,962 --> 01:02:04,340
<font color="#ffff00">You found your kid in the toilet, right?</font>

1153
01:02:05,065 --> 01:02:08,103
<font color="#ffff00">Jordan is a spaz.</font>

1154
01:02:10,604 --> 01:02:12,242
<font color="#ffff00">You're the spaz.</font>

1155
01:02:12,506 --> 01:02:15,919
<font color="#ffff00">You just don't get it. We love being dads.</font>

1156
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:19,857
<font color="#ffff00">When I was young,
I used to think I was so happy.</font>

1157
01:02:20,147 --> 01:02:22,525
<font color="#ffff00">But now, I know I'm happy.</font>

1158
01:02:22,983 --> 01:02:24,894
<font color="#ffff00">Exhausted</font>

1159
01:02:24,952 --> 01:02:26,795
<font color="#ffff00">but happy-</font>

1160
01:02:26,854 --> 01:02:28,993
<font color="#ffff00">I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.</font>

1161
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:32,763
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. You don't know true love
till you've wiped someone's butt.</font>

1162
01:02:33,761 --> 01:02:35,104

01:10:04,278 --> 01:10:06,588
<font color="#ffff00">What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be on the show!</font>

1294
01:10:06,647 --> 01:10:08,558
<font color="#ffff00">- Megan and I got kicked off.
- Oh, my God.</font>

1295
01:10:10,951 --> 01:10:12,157
<font color="#ffff00">Watch this. Watch this.</font>

1296
01:10:14,021 --> 01:10:16,524
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, God! Oh, my God!</font>

1297
01:10:17,057 --> 01:10:18,730
<font color="#ffff00">You threw your samba for me.</font>

1298
01:10:18,792 --> 01:10:21,739
<font color="#ffff00">The judges called it a "national disaster."</font>

1299
01:10:21,828 --> 01:10:24,468
<font color="#ffff00">I don't want anyone else
taking care of you.</font>

1300
01:10:24,531 --> 01:10:25,874
<font color="#ffff00">That's my job.</font>

1301
01:10:28,869 --> 01:10:32,009
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, look. You were right, okay? You win...</font>

1302
01:10:32,072 --> 01:10:34,780
<font color="#ffff00">Jules, I don't wanna be right.
I don't wanna win.</font>

1303
01:10:36,176 --> 01:10:39,851
<font color="#ffff00">I just want you and our baby safe. Okay?</font>

1304
01:10:42,149 --> 01:10:45,426
<font color="#ffff00"><i>That was actually, like,</i>
<i>a national disaster right there.</i></font>

1305
01:10:48,922 --> 01:10:50,833
<font color="#ffff00">Daddy's here.</font>

1306
01:10:52,526 --> 01:10:54,335
<font color="#ffff00">Daddy's here.</font>

1307
01:10:55,362 --> 01:10:58,639
<font color="#ffff00"><i>I'm gonna give you the one,</i>
<i>but it's not for the right reasons.</i></font>

1308
01:10:59,366 --> 01:11:01,004
<font color="#ffff00">See you tomorrow.</font>

1309
01:11:09,409 --> 01:11:11,355
<font color="#ffff00">If you want me to go, I'll go.</font>

1310
01:11:13,447 --> 01:11:14,482
<font color="#ffff00">What happened to your hand?</font>

1311
01:11:14,548 --> 01:11:17,461
<font color="#ffff00">Look. I want you to know that I get it.</font>

1312
01:11:17,517 --> 01:11:19,554
<font color="#ffff00">I'll probably never really understand
what you went through.</font>

1313
01:11:19,987 --> 01:11:22,194
<font color="#ffff00">But I don't want that to be the reason
we're not together.</font>

1314
01:11:22,889 --> 01:11:25,893
<font color="#ffff00">You were right,
I never even took you out on a real date.</font>

1315
01:11:27,127 --> 01:11:28,401
<font color="#ffff00">But I want to.</font>

1316
01:11:31,331 --> 01:11:32,366
<font color="#ffff00">I made these for you.</font>

1317
01:11:33,266 --> 01:11:34,973
<font color="#ffff00">Caramels.</font>

1318
01:11:35,035 --> 01:11:36,571
<font color="#ffff00">Piece-of-shit double boiler.</font>

1319
01:11:39,272 --> 01:11:40,478
<font color="#ffff00">I thought you said never again.</font>

1320
01:11:41,308 --> 01:11:43,151
<font color="#ffff00">Well, I made an exception.</font>

1321
01:11:48,015 --> 01:11:49,358
<font color="#ffff00">Marco, the reason we're not together</font>

1322
01:11:49,416 --> 01:11:51,327
<font color="#ffff00">has nothing to do with the fact
we were gonna have a baby.</font>

1323
01:11:51,385 --> 01:11:52,864
<font color="#ffff00">It wouldn't have worked anyway.</font>

1324
01:11:52,919 --> 01:11:56,162
<font color="#ffff00">That's bullshit, Rosie.
Give me one good reason.</font>

1325
01:11:56,757 --> 01:11:59,033
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, you don't have a car.</font>

1326
01:11:59,459 --> 01:12:02,599
<font color="#ffff00">What? Says the girl
with the duct-taped Civic.</font>

1327
01:12:03,063 --> 01:12:05,543
<font color="#ffff00">- Seriously?
- Fine. It's not the car.</font>

1328
01:12:05,599 --> 01:12:08,478
<font color="#ffff00">- You got me.
- Then what, Rosie? What?</font>

1329
01:12:08,535 --> 01:12:10,674
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause we were great.</font>

1330
01:12:12,205 --> 01:12:14,310
<font color="#ffff00">You know, you have the worst taste in girls.</font>

1331
01:12:14,374 --> 01:12:18,823
<font color="#ffff00">You go for the most obvious,
least-interesting chef groupies ever.</font>

1332
01:12:18,879 --> 01:12:20,449
<font color="#ffff00">What does that say about me
if that's what you're into?</font>

1333
01:12:20,514 --> 01:12:23,051
<font color="#ffff00">Well, they can't all be you, now can they?</font>

1334
01:12:23,884 --> 01:12:25,761
<font color="#ffff00">- You wanna know what it is?
- Yeah.</font>

1335
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:30,759
<font color="#ffff00">Every time I look at your face, it kills me.
Is that enough of a reason?</font>

1336
01:12:31,425 --> 01:12:33,837
<font color="#ffff00">Can we be done
with this conversation, please?</font>

1337
01:12:35,429 --> 01:12:37,739
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. We can be done.</font>

1338
01:12:38,331 --> 01:12:39,776
<font color="#ffff00">Here.</font>

1339
01:12:41,301 --> 01:12:44,874
<font color="#ffff00">No. I don't even like caramels.
Just keep them. Take them.</font>

1340
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:58,862
<font color="#ffff00">- Holly, thank you for coming.
- Sure.</font>

1341
01:12:58,952 --> 01:13:01,262
<font color="#ffff00">- I can't wait to see this.
- It's a little big.</font>

1342
01:13:01,321 --> 01:13:04,200
<font color="#ffff00">- Well, you know we wanted it big.
- I know.</font>

1343
01:13:05,459 --> 01:13:07,132
<font color="#ffff00">All right, let's see it.</font>

1344
01:13:07,194 --> 01:13:10,403
<font color="#ffff00">You might wanna wait
till you get home to open it, I think.</font>

1345
01:13:10,664 --> 01:13:11,972
<font color="#ffff00">No, I wanna see it right here.</font>

1346
01:13:13,033 --> 01:13:14,341
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

1347
01:13:16,203 --> 01:13:18,809
<font color="#ffff00">I did it exactly how you want.</font>

1348
01:13:22,275 --> 01:13:23,982
<font color="#ffff00">I love it! I love it!</font>

1349
01:13:24,044 --> 01:13:26,422
<font color="#ffff00">- You do? Good.
- I love it!</font>

1350
01:13:27,681 --> 01:13:28,955
<font color="#ffff00">Holly!</font>

1351
01:13:29,649 --> 01:13:31,356
<font color="#ffff00">And when you come back from Africa</font>

1352
01:13:31,418 --> 01:13:34,627
<font color="#ffff00">I'm gonna get you to take a picture of
these twins, and my stepson's baby.</font>

1353
01:13:34,688 --> 01:13:36,929
<font color="#ffff00">I mean,
you are gonna be our family photographer!</font>

1354
01:13:38,058 --> 01:13:39,298
<font color="#ffff00">Hey!</font>

1355
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:41,237
<font color="#ffff00">I felt a kick in there!</font>

1356
01:13:42,729 --> 01:13:45,039
<font color="#ffff00">I'm gonna cover this up for you.</font>

1357
01:13:45,732 --> 01:13:46,802
<font color="#ffff00">Do you wanna feel?</font>

1358
01:13:51,571 --> 01:13:52,606
<font color="#ffff00">Sure.</font>

1359
01:13:53,473 --> 01:13:55,680
<font color="#ffff00">It's two in there, yeah?</font>

1360
01:14:02,349 --> 01:14:04,488
<font color="#ffff00">- Do you feel that?
- Yeah.</font>

1361
01:14:08,722 --> 01:14:10,668
<font color="#ffff00">It really is a miracle, isn't it?</font>

1362
01:14:44,357 --> 01:14:47,361
<font color="#ffff00">- Wendy! There you are!
- Hi, here I am.</font>

1363
01:14:47,427 --> 01:14:51,842
<font color="#ffff00">And looking so fantastic!
We are so glad you agreed to speak.</font>

1364
01:14:51,932 --> 01:14:55,539
<font color="#ffff00">Hello, there! Aren't you just loving it?</font>

1365
01:14:55,635 --> 01:14:58,275
<font color="#ffff00">Experiencing everything for yourself?</font>

1366
01:14:58,338 --> 01:15:01,251
<font color="#ffff00">You must be ecstatic,
every second of every day.</font>

1367
01:15:01,308 --> 01:15:04,517
<font color="#ffff00">Every day, every second, totally ecstatic.</font>

1368
01:15:07,847 --> 01:15:08,917
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, Wendy.</font>

1369
01:15:09,649 --> 01:15:13,222
<font color="#ffff00">We have to get some of these for the store.
It tastes like real nipple.</font>

1370
01:15:13,286 --> 01:15:15,357
<font color="#ffff00">Janice, I don't think I can do this.</font>

1371
01:15:15,422 --> 01:15:18,801
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, I can't go out there
and just act like everything's peachy.</font>

1372
01:15:18,892 --> 01:15:20,462
<font color="#ffff00">I really feel like crap.</font>

1373
01:15:20,727 --> 01:15:22,172
<font color="#ffff00">It's so hot.</font>

1374
01:15:22,395 --> 01:15:24,898
<font color="#ffff00">You can do it.
Just put one cankle in front of the other.</font>

1375
01:15:25,498 --> 01:15:28,502
<font color="#ffff00">Get out there and tell the truth
and share your wisdom.</font>

1376
01:15:28,735 --> 01:15:31,614
<font color="#ffff00">Janice, I just peed myself.</font>

1377
01:15:31,805 --> 01:15:33,682
<font color="#ffff00">- That's natural.
- No, Janice.</font>

1378
01:15:35,809 --> 01:15:37,618
<font color="#ffff00">Like a lot.</font>

1379
01:15:38,144 --> 01:15:41,455
<font color="#ffff00">And now, please welcome
our keynote speaker,</font>

1380
01:15:41,514 --> 01:15:44,290
<font color="#ffff00">Wendy Cooper of The Breast Choice!</font>

1381
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:55,934
<font color="#ffff00">Hi. That's me, here?</font>

1382
01:15:55,996 --> 01:15:57,737
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

1383
01:15:57,797 --> 01:15:59,401
<font color="#ffff00">I sit here. Okay.</font>

1384
01:16:03,003 --> 01:16:04,073
<font color="#ffff00">Janice?</font>

1385
01:16:04,137 --> 01:16:06,515
<font color="#ffff00">- Janice? Sweetie?
- What?</font>

1386
01:16:06,673 --> 01:16:08,448
<font color="#ffff00">Get my speech. Get my speech.</font>

1387
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:10,745
<font color="#ffff00">- In my pocket!
- What?</font>

1388
01:16:12,112 --> 01:16:13,648
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry.</font>

1389
01:16:16,616 --> 01:16:18,186
<font color="#ffff00">- Okay.
- My God.</font>

1390
01:16:18,818 --> 01:16:19,956
<font color="#ffff00">- Okay.
- Hi there.</font>

1391
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:22,557
<font color="#ffff00">What's this liquid on my butt?</font>

1392
01:16:23,156 --> 01:16:25,067
<font color="#ffff00">No. Don't. Okay, thank you.</font>

1393
01:16:25,125 --> 01:16:26,661
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe I just</font>

1394
01:16:27,727 --> 01:16:31,106
<font color="#ffff00">- peed myself 'cause I'm pregnant
- No.No.</font>

1395
01:16:31,598 --> 01:16:32,633
<font color="#ffff00">- No.
- Yeah.</font>

1396
01:16:32,699 --> 01:16:36,647
<font color="#ffff00">And that's why I go to The Breast Choice
for all my pregnancy needs.</font>

1397
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:38,415
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you, Janice.</font>

1398
01:16:38,471 --> 01:16:39,882
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

1399
01:16:40,407 --> 01:16:42,045
<font color="#ffff00">- Over to Wendy.
- Yep.</font>

1400
01:16:42,242 --> 01:16:44,586
<font color="#ffff00">- Tell them about your glow.
- Thank you, Janice.</font>

1401
01:16:47,047 --> 01:16:51,325
<font color="#ffff00">The magical, happy miracle,
experiencing pregnancy.</font>

1402
01:16:54,154 --> 01:16:58,762
<font color="#ffff00">Pregnancy's glow is made
from two scoops of angel kisses.</font>

1403
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:04,509
<font color="#ffff00">It begins when you feel the first...</font>

1404
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:08,437
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry.</font>

1405
01:17:09,336 --> 01:17:11,714
<font color="#ffff00">Hormones! Right?</font>

1406
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,946
<font color="#ffff00">I just find myself crying all the time.</font>

1407
01:17:20,347 --> 01:17:22,418
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, you know what? The truth...</font>

1408
01:17:23,616 --> 01:17:25,061
<font color="#ffff00">The truth is...</font>

1409
01:17:27,354 --> 01:17:30,733
<font color="#ffff00">I can't think with this thing on.
I'm sorry. I am so uncomfortable.</font>

1410
01:17:30,924 --> 01:17:34,633
<font color="#ffff00">I don't even recognize my body anymore,
you know?</font>

1411
01:17:34,694 --> 01:17:37,538
<font color="#ffff00">It's like I could fit 20 of my old bras</font>

1412
01:17:37,597 --> 01:17:41,409
<font color="#ffff00">into this one giant piece
of Granny spandex that's just...</font>

1413
01:17:43,570 --> 01:17:44,947
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

1414
01:17:45,004 --> 01:17:46,381
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you.</font>

1415
01:17:46,439 --> 01:17:48,851
<font color="#ffff00">- Should we all take off our bras?
- I think we're good.</font>

1416
01:17:48,908 --> 01:17:51,514
<font color="#ffff00">- It's a bit small.
- No. Please don't.</font>

1417
01:17:51,945 --> 01:17:54,551
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry.
I didn't think about any of this stuff</font>

1418
01:17:54,748 --> 01:17:58,127
<font color="#ffff00">before I got pregnant.</font>

1419
01:17:59,953 --> 01:18:01,523
<font color="#ffff00">I just wanted the glow.</font>

1420
01:18:03,156 --> 01:18:07,969
<font color="#ffff00">The one they promise you on the cover
of those magazines, with the pretty lady</font>

1421
01:18:09,162 --> 01:18:13,611
<font color="#ffff00">looking down at her perfectly round belly
with that sweet smile.</font>

1422
01:18:16,069 --> 01:18:18,174

the scale says tonight.</font>

How you doing there, Tater Tot?</font>

1567
01:26:00,466 --> 01:26:02,707

Ram Bam.</font>

1568
01:26:02,768 --> 01:26:04,304

but I can always record it.</font>

1573
01:26:12,845 --> 01:26:15,951
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, yes. I just cannot find my keys.
That's all I have to do.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Hey! Look at this. I've got them.</font>

1575

<font color="#ffff00">Honey, do you have your driver's license?</font>

1576
01:26:20,286 --> 01:26:22,197
<font color="#ffff00">- Because I don't have my driver's license.
- Gar!</font>

you worthless piece of shit!</font>

1582
01:26:44,644 --> 01:26:46,385
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry, baby, I love you.
You know I do, right?</font>

1583
01:26:46,846 --> 01:26:48,416
<font color="#ffff00">I love you, too.</font>

1584

1586
01:26:55,554 --> 01:26:57,431
<font color="#ffff00">- My foot! My foot!
- Are you okay? Is it broken?</font>

1587
01:26:58,257 --> 01:26:59,292
<font color="#ffff00">Don't be such a baby.</font>

1588
01:26:59,492 --> 01:27:00,766
<font color="#ffff00">Just pull into any of these spots.</font>

1589
01:27:00,826 --> 01:27:03,466
<font color="#ffff00">- Right here. Any of these spots.
- Which one?</font>

1590
01:27:03,529 --> 01:27:04,564
<font color="#ffff00">Good. Perfect.</font>

1591
01:27:07,366 --> 01:27:08,401
<font color="#ffff00">Don't touch!</font>

1592
01:27:09,201 --> 01:27:12,045
<font color="#ffff00">Whoa! The floor's a little wet.
They've got to do something about that.</font>

1593
01:27:12,238 --> 01:27:13,649
<font color="#ffff00">That's my water, you idiot.</font>

1594
01:27:14,607 --> 01:27:15,915
<font color="#ffff00">You're doing great, hon.</font>

1595
01:27:17,643 --> 01:27:19,919
<font color="#ffff00">Man! Why did you do that?</font>

1596
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:24,557
<font color="#ffff00">Stop! Here comes another one.
Here comes another one.</font>

1597
01:27:26,919 --> 01:27:29,490
<font color="#ffff00">Where's the valet?
I don't see a valet around here.</font>

1598
01:27:33,125 --> 01:27:35,765
<font color="#ffff00">- Wow. Are we moving?
- Yes.</font>

1599
01:27:36,095 --> 01:27:38,097
<font color="#ffff00">- Babe, did you press the button?
- Yes.</font>

1600

<font color="#ffff00">You're doing great.</font>

1601
01:27:43,970 --> 01:27:45,745
<font color="#ffff00">Baby, watch out, the floor's wet.</font>

1602
01:27:46,939 --> 01:27:48,646
<font color="#ffff00">What the hell is that?</font>

1603
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:52,145
<font color="#ffff00">We're here, Jules.</font>

1604
01:27:52,244 --> 01:27:55,088
<font color="#ffff00">I don't care about his penis.
Who gives a shit?</font>

1605
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:57,650
<font color="#ffff00">We're having a baby!</font>

1606
01:27:58,250 --> 01:27:59,957
<font color="#ffff00">- Okay, okay, good.
- The Baby Center.</font>

1607
01:28:00,019 --> 01:28:01,157
<font color="#ffff00">The Baby Center. So we're in the right place.</font>

1608
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:02,221
<font color="#ffff00">- Hi.
- Hi.</font>

1609
01:28:02,288 --> 01:28:03,289
<font color="#ffff00">- We're the Coopers.
- Hi.</font>

1610
01:28:03,356 --> 01:28:04,357
<font color="#ffff00">- We pre-registered.
- Yeah.</font>

1611
01:28:04,423 --> 01:28:05,458
<font color="#ffff00">Okay. Got you.</font>

1612
01:28:05,524 --> 01:28:07,663
<font color="#ffff00">- I've got my birth plan!
- Aren't you organized.</font>

1613
01:28:08,427 --> 01:28:09,462
<font color="#ffff00">Skyler Cooper.</font>

1614
01:28:09,662 --> 01:28:12,006
<font color="#ffff00">- Another Cooper?
- We reserved a deluxe suite.</font>

1615
01:28:12,231 --> 01:28:13,266
<font color="#ffff00">And this is your father?</font>

1616
01:28:13,466 --> 01:28:14,968
<font color="#ffff00">He's my husband.</font>

1617
01:28:15,167 --> 01:28:17,408
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry. Husband. Great.</font>

1618
01:28:17,603 --> 01:28:18,741
<font color="#ffff00">We're having a baby.</font>

1619
01:28:18,971 --> 01:28:20,245
<font color="#ffff00">I know you.</font>

1620
01:28:20,706 --> 01:28:21,707
<font color="#ffff00">I can do it!</font>

1621
01:28:21,774 --> 01:28:24,914
<font color="#ffff00">That's it. With your help,
I've lost eight pounds.</font>

1622
01:28:25,277 --> 01:28:26,722
<font color="#ffff00">Can you help me do the same?</font>

1623
01:28:27,146 --> 01:28:29,092
<font color="#ffff00">Do you happen to have
a room service menu?</font>

1624
01:28:29,148 --> 01:28:31,185
<font color="#ffff00">On a scale of 1 to 10,
how is your pain right now?</font>

1625
01:28:32,151 --> 01:28:33,152
<font color="#ffff00">Two.</font>

1626
01:28:33,219 --> 01:28:34,857
<font color="#ffff00">All right. Tough girl.</font>

1627
01:28:35,654 --> 01:28:36,689
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe a three.</font>

1628
01:28:37,757 --> 01:28:40,033
<font color="#ffff00">Was that a contraction? I barely even felt it.</font>

1629
01:28:40,259 --> 01:28:43,297
<font color="#ffff00">Sure was. What's your pain level,
on a scale of 1 to 10?</font>

1630
01:28:44,497 --> 01:28:47,444
<font color="#ffff00">Like a zero to a one.
Because I'm smiling, we're smiling.</font>

1631
01:28:47,633 --> 01:28:49,544
<font color="#ffff00">You're number one, baby.</font>

1632
01:28:50,536 --> 01:28:52,106
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, who wants to have a baby?</font>

1633
01:28:52,171 --> 01:28:53,741
<font color="#ffff00">Where the hell have you been?</font>

1634
01:28:53,806 --> 01:28:56,582
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, let's talk pain.
On a scale of 1 to 10, what do you feel?</font>

1635
01:28:57,910 --> 01:28:59,287
<font color="#ffff00">What are you, I think, maybe a six?</font>

1636
01:28:59,345 --> 01:29:02,053
<font color="#ffff00">What? I'm an eight! Frown, no tears. Eight.</font>

1637
01:29:02,114 --> 01:29:03,320
<font color="#ffff00">Are you getting an epidural?</font>

1638
01:29:03,382 --> 01:29:05,521
<font color="#ffff00">Do I look like somebody
who wants to drug my baby?</font>

1639
01:29:05,584 --> 01:29:06,927
<font color="#ffff00">Are y'all planning an epidural?</font>

1640
01:29:07,253 --> 01:29:09,790
<font color="#ffff00">- I don't know. I guess we'll see how it goes.
- Whatever.</font>

1641
01:29:09,889 --> 01:29:11,232
<font color="#ffff00">So do you want an epidural?</font>

1642
01:29:11,290 --> 01:29:13,236
<font color="#ffff00">Hell, no. Let's do this.</font>

1643
01:29:13,459 --> 01:29:14,460
<font color="#ffff00">That's right.</font>

1644
01:29:15,394 --> 01:29:17,067
<font color="#ffff00">- Here comes another one.
- Okay, breathe.</font>

1645
01:29:29,208 --> 01:29:31,154
<font color="#ffff00">- Gar?
- Yeah?</font>

1646
01:29:31,811 --> 01:29:34,917
<font color="#ffff00">I changed my mind. I want the epidural.
I want it, Gary.</font>

1647
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:37,017
<font color="#ffff00">No, no, honey. No, no, no.
You said you didn't want it</font>

1648
01:29:37,083 --> 01:29:40,587
<font color="#ffff00">and you said that even if you did ask for it,
that would just be the crazy talking...</font>

1649
01:29:40,653 --> 01:29:43,133
<font color="#ffff00">Gary! Get me the juice!</font>

1650
01:29:43,189 --> 01:29:45,692
<font color="#ffff00">That seemed a little crazy
I will get you the juice.</font>

1651
01:29:45,758 --> 01:29:47,169
<font color="#ffff00">I need it, Gar.</font>

1652
01:29:47,226 --> 01:29:49,797
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry, baby.
Just don't come back without it, okay?</font>

1653
01:29:49,862 --> 01:29:51,102
<font color="#ffff00">- No anchovies on that, right?
- Hey, Dad!</font>

1654
01:29:51,163 --> 01:29:53,609
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, son! Hey, you, too?</font>

1655
01:29:53,666 --> 01:29:55,043
<font color="#ffff00">It's not a race, Dad.</font>

1656
01:29:55,768 --> 01:29:56,974
<font color="#ffff00">That's my son.</font>

1657
01:29:57,036 --> 01:29:58,640
<font color="#ffff00">Hey! Are you the anesthesiologist?</font>

1658
01:29:58,804 --> 01:29:59,839
<font color="#ffff00">- Yes, sir.
- Okay.</font>

1659
01:29:59,905 --> 01:30:01,680
<font color="#ffff00">My wife changed her mind.
She needs the epidural right now.</font>

1660
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:03,845
<font color="#ffff00">I've got five women in front of her.
It's gonna be a little while.</font>

1661
01:30:03,909 --> 01:30:05,354
<font color="#ffff00">No, no, no, no. That's not okay.
She's in pain.</font>

1662
01:30:05,411 --> 01:30:06,481
<font color="#ffff00">Everybody's in pain.</font>

1663
01:30:06,545 --> 01:30:09,549
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, hold on. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.</font>

1664
01:30:09,615 --> 01:30:11,117
<font color="#ffff00">- Wait, wait! Wait!
- Really?</font>

1665
01:30:13,052 --> 01:30:14,224
<font color="#ffff00">- Dad! Dad!
- Yeah?</font>

1666
01:30:14,286 --> 01:30:15,788
<font color="#ffff00">I need your money roll.
I need your money roll.</font>

1667
01:30:15,855 --> 01:30:17,664
<font color="#ffff00">Sure. How much you need?</font>

1668
01:30:17,723 --> 01:30:19,669
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. Okay.</font>

1669
01:30:22,027 --> 01:30:23,631
<font color="#ffff00">The crazy lady in 408 is next.</font>

1670
01:30:23,863 --> 01:30:25,171
<font color="#ffff00">She most certainly is, sir.</font>

1671
01:30:25,464 --> 01:30:30,140
<font color="#ffff00">You're gonna feel a little bit of pressure
in one or both legs. That's normal.</font>

1672
01:30:30,469 --> 01:30:32,415
<font color="#ffff00">You are so clutch, baby.</font>

1673
01:30:32,972 --> 01:30:34,474
<font color="#ffff00">So clutch.</font>

1674
01:30:35,141 --> 01:30:37,087
<font color="#ffff00">You're at eight centimeters.</font>

1675
01:30:38,043 --> 01:30:40,045
<font color="#ffff00">- Two more! I can push!
- Two more.</font>

1676
01:30:40,412 --> 01:30:41,823
<font color="#ffff00">Nine centimeters.</font>

1677
01:30:41,881 --> 01:30:42,985
<font color="#ffff00">Great!</font>

1678
01:30:43,048 --> 01:30:44,493
<font color="#ffff00">What is that in inches?</font>

1679
01:30:45,484 --> 01:30:47,760
<font color="#ffff00">You're at ten centimeters,
but the baby's not coming.</font>

1680
01:30:47,987 --> 01:30:50,194
<font color="#ffff00">We need to prepare for a C-Section.</font>

1681
01:30:50,256 --> 01:30:52,293
<font color="#ffff00">No, no, no, no. I have a birth plan.</font>

1682
01:30:52,358 --> 01:30:53,393
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, we...</font>

<font color="#ffff00">I want to push. I want to push.</font>

1684
01:30:54,994 --> 01:30:57,907
<font color="#ffff00">I know, Wendy, but the baby's heart rate
is falling. We need to move now.</font>

1685
01:30:58,097 --> 01:30:59,132
<font color="#ffff00">It's going to be okay.</font>

1686
01:30:59,498 --> 01:31:03,412
<font color="#ffff00">But I typed it. It's typed.
The birth plan, it's ready to go.</font>

1687
01:31:03,469 --> 01:31:06,279
<font color="#ffff00">I'm ready to push. I wanna push
Please, I wanna push.</font>

1688
01:31:06,839 --> 01:31:07,874
<font color="#ffff00">Please?</font>

1689
01:31:08,841 --> 01:31:11,253
<font color="#ffff00">So, Jules, you've been doing well.
Let's take a look, all right?</font>

1690
01:31:12,978 --> 01:31:14,855
<font color="#ffff00">Okay. Let's do this.</font>

1691

<font color="#ffff00">- Push.
- I can do it.</font>

1695
01:31:22,021 --> 01:31:23,056
<font color="#ffff00">Say "I can do it."</font>

1696
01:31:23,122 --> 01:31:24,533

- Come on, Jules. Yeah!</font>

1697
01:31:24,590 --> 01:31:27,799
<font color="#ffff00">I can do... No, I can't do this!</font>

1698
01:31:30,829 --> 01:31:31,967
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, Skyler.</font>

1699
01:31:32,431 --> 01:31:35,139
<font color="#ffff00">You're doing great, Tater Tot.
Just hang in there.</font>

1700
01:31:35,201 --> 01:31:38,774
<font color="#ffff00">Bear down and give it all you've got.
Ready?</font>

1701
01:31:39,138 --> 01:31:40,879
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, hang on. I have to sneeze.</font>

1702
01:31:45,844 --> 01:31:47,517
<font color="#ffff00">Wow. That's one baby out.</font>

1703
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:49,560
<font color="#ffff00">One down, one to go.</font>

1704
01:31:57,690 --> 01:31:59,033
<font color="#ffff00">You did this to me!</font>

1705
01:32:00,059 --> 01:32:02,733
<font color="#ffff00">That pig is wearing flippers.</font>

1706
01:32:06,365 --> 01:32:07,469
<font color="#ffff00">Clamps.</font>

1707
01:32:08,634 --> 01:32:10,477
<font color="#ffff00">I love morphine.</font>

1708
01:32:12,037 --> 01:32:14,176
<font color="#ffff00">Don't you love morphine, Gar?</font>

1709
01:32:14,373 --> 01:32:15,408
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

1710
01:32:15,708 --> 01:32:17,984
<font color="#ffff00">We should get some for the house.</font>

1711
01:32:18,611 --> 01:32:19,749
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

1712
01:32:20,279 --> 01:32:22,281
<font color="#ffff00">That's good. That's good. Almost there.</font>

1713
01:32:22,715 --> 01:32:25,855
<font color="#ffff00">You're doing great, Squeaks.
This guy's got a real steady hand.</font>

1714
01:32:27,453 --> 01:32:28,659
<font color="#ffff00">- You're fine.
- Yeah.</font>

1715

<font color="#ffff00">Here he is.</font>

1716
01:32:41,033 --> 01:32:42,239

1718
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,285
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, Jules. This is it. Are you ready?</font>

1719
01:32:49,608 --> 01:32:52,612
<font color="#ffff00">All right. I need you to bear down and push.
All right? Here we go.</font>

1720
01:32:52,678 --> 01:32:54,055
<font color="#ffff00">- Okay.
- Push! Push! Push!</font>

1721
01:32:54,113 --> 01:32:55,456
<font color="#ffff00">Come on, Jules. You can do it.</font>

1722
01:32:55,681 --> 01:32:57,786

<font color="#ffff00">I see his head, Jules.</font>

1724
01:33:00,286 --> 01:33:01,788
<font color="#ffff00">- Give me one more giant push, all right?
- He's beautiful.</font>

1725
01:33:01,887 --> 01:33:04,299
<font color="#ffff00">I need the shoulders out. And push!</font>

1726
01:33:07,626 --> 01:33:08,969
<font color="#ffff00">That's good. That's good.</font>

1727
01:33:11,397 --> 01:33:12,398
<font color="#ffff00">All right.</font>

1728
01:33:12,931 --> 01:33:15,434
<font color="#ffff00">And it's a girl!</font>

1729
01:33:17,970 --> 01:33:19,210
<font color="#ffff00">It's a girl!</font>

1730
01:33:23,142 --> 01:33:25,088
<font color="#ffff00">- A girl's good. I like girls.
- It's a girl.</font>

1736
01:33:46,165 --> 01:33:47,667
<font color="#ffff00">Emerson. I love it.</font>

1737
01:33:55,307 --> 01:33:57,082
<font color="#ffff00">Jules, I knew you could do it.</font>

1738
01:33:58,977 --> 01:34:00,320
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you.</font>

1742
01:34:15,828 --> 01:34:18,809
<font color="#ffff00">Say hi to Mama. Can you say hi to Mama?</font>

1743
01:34:19,698 --> 01:34:23,305
<font color="#ffff00">Say hi to Mama. Yeah, that's Mama's finger.</font>

1744
01:34:24,770 --> 01:34:26,408
<font color="#ffff00">- Wendy? Hey, guys.
- We need more suction here.</font>

Mr. Cooper, I think you need to step out.</font>

1750
01:34:33,879 --> 01:34:36,223
<font color="#ffff00">We have everything under control in here.
It's okay. Come with me.</font>

1751
01:34:36,281 --> 01:34:38,989
<font color="#ffff00">Wendy, are you gonna be all right? Wendy?</font>

1752

1757
01:34:54,733 --> 01:34:56,610

<font color="#ffff00">so they made me wait out here.</font>

1759
01:34:58,704 --> 01:35:01,514
<font color="#ffff00">So I don't know what's going on inside.</font>

1760
01:35:01,573 --> 01:35:04,281
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause they made me wait out here.</font>

1761

1762
01:35:07,579 --> 01:35:09,991
<font color="#ffff00">I'm here for you. All right?</font>

1763
01:35:10,048 --> 01:35:11,493
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks, Dad.</font>

1783
01:37:39,898 --> 01:37:43,812
<font color="#ffff00">The little stuff, probably not.
The big stuff? Yes.</font>

01:39:51,863 --> 01:39:54,776
<font color="#ffff00">- What are you doing here?
- My cousin,</font>

1818
01:39:54,966 --> 01:39:57,503
<font color="#ffff00">the one married to that old...
The racecar dude.</font>

1819
01:39:57,569 --> 01:40:00,311
<font color="#ffff00">- Oh, yeah.
- She had her babies, she had twins.</font>

1820
01:40:00,539 --> 01:40:02,951
<font color="#ffff00">- Nice. Congratulations. That's great.
- Thanks.</font>

1821
01:40:04,242 --> 01:40:05,653
<font color="#ffff00">I was gonna go see them.</font>

1822
01:40:07,479 --> 01:40:08,787
<font color="#ffff00">Do you wanna?</font>

1823
01:40:09,414 --> 01:40:12,054
<font color="#ffff00">- What?
- I don't know if that's weird.</font>

1824
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:14,093
<font color="#ffff00">It's a little weird,</font>

1825
01:40:15,153 --> 01:40:16,962
<font color="#ffff00">but, yeah, I'd love to.</font>

1826
01:40:22,661 --> 01:40:23,935
<font color="#ffff00">You okay?</font>

1827
01:40:24,429 --> 01:40:27,672
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. I'll have another chance
when the time's right.</font>

1828
01:40:28,166 --> 01:40:29,236
<font color="#ffff00">You will.</font>

1829
01:40:32,270 --> 01:40:34,409
<font color="#ffff00">Those caramels were delicious, by the way.</font>

1830
01:40:34,606 --> 01:40:36,950
<font color="#ffff00">The car-mels were really good,
weren't they?</font>

1831
01:40:37,008 --> 01:40:38,248
<font color="#ffff00">- Car-mels?
- Yeah.</font>

1832
01:40:38,744 --> 01:40:40,849
<font color="#ffff00">Caramels. What is wrong with you?</font>

1833
01:40:42,481 --> 01:40:45,394
<font color="#ffff00">That's one good-looking kid you got there,
Dr. Cooper.</font>

1834
01:40:45,584 --> 01:40:46,756
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks. You, too.</font>

1835
01:40:46,818 --> 01:40:49,196
<font color="#ffff00">When you were born,
I wasn't even in the room.</font>

1836
01:40:49,287 --> 01:40:50,789
<font color="#ffff00">Back then, no dad was.</font>

1837
01:40:51,089 --> 01:40:53,262
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. Maybe that was a good thing though.</font>

1838
01:40:53,625 --> 01:40:55,969
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know. I missed a lot.</font>

1839
01:40:56,828 --> 01:40:59,672
<font color="#ffff00">End of the day, family's all that matters.</font>

1840
01:40:59,898 --> 01:41:02,606
<font color="#ffff00">Not the races, and the trophies,
and the endorsements.</font>

1841
01:41:02,667 --> 01:41:06,809
<font color="#ffff00">Not the money and the women,
and the sex, and the drugs.</font>

1842
01:41:08,306 --> 01:41:12,345
<font color="#ffff00">Partying with Jimmy Buffett
on the back of Willie Nelson's bus.</font>

1843
01:41:14,446 --> 01:41:17,689
<font color="#ffff00">None of that means jack shit when I'm gone.</font>

1844
01:41:18,183 --> 01:41:20,857
<font color="#ffff00">But you guys. My kids,</font>

1845
01:41:21,486 --> 01:41:23,989
<font color="#ffff00">that's all we really leave behind.</font>

1846
01:41:33,532 --> 01:41:37,173
<font color="#ffff00">Say, "Mommy." Say, "Mama."</font>
